## Task 1: Web Scraping and Text Analysis
Overview
This task involves collecting data through web scraping and performing various text analysis techniques on customer reviews of British Airways.

### Steps
Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup:

### Objective: Collect customer reviews from the British Airways website.

### Method: Use the BeautifulSoup library in Python to parse HTML content.

### Process:
  Identify the target URL(s) where the reviews are located.
  Send an HTTP request to the website and fetch the HTML content.
  Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant information (e.g., review text, rating, date of review).
  Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as a Pandas DataFrame or a CSV file.

### Text Analysis Methods:

  ### Objective: Analyze the textual data to extract meaningful insights.
  ### Methods:
  ### Sentiment Analysis:
    ### Sentiment Polarity: Determine the sentiment of each review (positive, negative, or neutral) using libraries like TextBlob.
    ### Sentiment Distribution: Analyze the distribution of sentiments across all reviews to understand the overall customer sentiment.
    ### Text Modeling:
  ### Topic Modeling: Identify the main topics discussed in the reviews using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
  ### Word Cloud:
    ### Objective: Visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.
    ### Method: Generate a word cloud using libraries like WordCloud in Python.

### Expected Output:
A dataset of customer reviews with additional fields for sentiment polarity and topics.
Visualizations of sentiment distribution and word cloud of frequent words.

## Task 2: Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings

### Data Preprocessing
### Objective: Prepare data for predictive modeling.

### Methods:
  ### OneHot-Encoding:
  Convert nominal categorical variables to binary vectors using pd.get_dummies().
  ### Label-Encoding:
  Convert ordinal categorical variables to integer values using LabelEncoder.

### Predictive Modeling
### Objective: Predict customer bookings using logistic regression.
### Steps:
  Split data into training and test sets.
  Train logistic regression model on training data.
  Evaluate model performance on test data (accuracy, precision, recall).
  Feature Importance:
  Identify important features using model coefficients.
  Visualize feature importance with a bar plot.
